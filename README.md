# REBS_assignment_2

Public repository for REBS assignment 2. We have implemented option 1, semantics for nested groups, in [semantics.py](semantics.py). Place this under pm4py/objects/dcr/hierachial of an existing pm4py-dcr installation.

Examples using our implementation can be found in [this notebook](rebs2024_assignment2_v2.ipynb)
